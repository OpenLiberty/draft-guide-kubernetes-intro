= Deploying microservices to Kubernetes

Explore how to deploy microservices to Kubernetes and manage them with the kubectl Kubernetes CLI.

:minikube-ip: 192.168.99.100
:kube: Kubernetes


== What you'll learn

You will learn how to deploy two microservices to a local {kube} cluster using the Kubernetes package
manager called Helm. Helm allows you to install packages or charts, which are sets of preconfigured
{kube} resources. Installing charts is much more convenient than creating and configuring Kubernetes
resources yourself. You will then manage your deployed microservices using the `kubectl` command line
interface for {kube}. The `kubectl` CLI is your primary tool for communicating with and managing your
{kube} cluster.

The two microservices you will deploy are called `name` and `ping` and are provided for you in the
`start` directory. The `name` microservice simply displays a brief greeting and the name of the
container that it runs in, making it easy to distinguish it from its other replicas. The `ping` microservice
simply pings the {kube} Service that encapsulates the Pods running the `name` microservice, demonstrating
how communication can be established between Pods inside a cluster.

You will use Minikube as your local {kube} cluster. Minikube is a single-node {kube} cluster that
runs in a local virtual machine. You will also use NGINX as your Ingress controller, which you will
enable as an add-on in Minikube.


// =================================================================================================
// What is {kube}
// =================================================================================================

== What is {kube}?

{kube} is an open source container orchestrator that automates many tasks involved in deploying,
managing, and scaling containerized applications.

Over the years, {kube} has become a major tool in containerized environments as containers are being
more and more utilized for all steps of a continuous delivery pipeline.

=== Why use {kube}?

Managing containers on their own can be challenging. While a few containers used for development by
a small team might not pose a problem, a large number of containers, all running various applications,
all sharing databases, all communicating with each other, and all needing to be run and monitored
every day of the week will give even a large team of experienced developers a headache. {kube} is a
developer's primary tool in containerized
environments. It handles scheduling, deployment, as well as mass deletion and creation of containers.
It provides update rollout capabilities on a large scale that would otherwise prove extremely tedious
to do. Imagine that you updated a Docker image, which now needs to propagate to a dozen containers.
While you could destroy and then recreate these containers, you could also issue a short one-line
command and have {kube} do all that updating for you. Of course this is just a simple example. There
is much more underneath the iceberg that is {kube}.

// {kube} provides much other functionality
// that simply makes your development, testing, and production environments much more stable, much more
// automated, and much more powerful to use. Some of this functionality, we're hoping you can learn in
// this guide.

=== Architecture

Deploying an application to Kubernetes simply means deploying an application to a Kubernetes cluster.

A typical {kube} cluster is a collection of physical or virtual machines called `nodes` that run
containerized applications. A cluster is made up of one master `node` that manages the cluster, and
multiple worker `nodes` that run the actual application instances inside {kube} objects called `Pods`.

A `Pod` is a basic building block in a {kube} cluster. It represents a single running process that
encapsulates a container or in some scenarios multiple closely coupled containers. `Pods` can be
replicated to scale applications and handle more traffic. From the perspective of a cluster, a set
of replicated `Pods` is still one application instance, although it might be made up of dozens of
instances of itself. A single `Pod` or a group of replicated `Pods` are managed by {kube} objects
called `Controllers`. A `Controller` handles replication, self-healing, rollout of updates, and general
management of `Pods`. Some examples of `Controllers` include `Deployments`, `StatefulSets`, and `DaemonSets`.
In this guide, you will work with `Deployments`.

A `Pod` or a group of replicated `Pods` are further grouped inside {kube} objects called `Services`
that define a set of rules by which the `Pods` can be accessed. In a basic scenario, a {kube}
`Service` will expose a node port that can be used together with the cluster IP address to access
the `Pods` encapsulated by the `Service`. In this guide, however, you will set up an `Ingress`, which
is a {kube} object that maps external requests to the `Services` inside a cluster as well as provides
additional functionality.


// =================================================================================================
// Prerequisites
// =================================================================================================

== Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure to have the following tools installed:

- `kubernetes-cli` - a command line interface for {kube} called `kubectl`. For installation instructions see
https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/
- `kubernetes-helm` - a package manager for {kube} called Helm. For installation instructions see
https://docs.helm.sh/using_helm/\#installing-helm
- `minikube` - a local, single-node {kube} cluster that runs in a virtual machine. For installation
instructions see https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube

Finally, you will need a containerization software for building containers. {kube} supports a variety
of container types and, while you're not limited to any of them in particular, you should use Docker
as it's what this guide will focus on. For installation instructions, see https://docs.docker.com/install/.

// =================================================================================================
// Staring and preparing your cluster for deployment
// =================================================================================================

== Starting and preparing your cluster for deployment

To begin working with your Minikube cluster run the following command from the command line:

```
minikube start
```

If you're on Windows and you run into issues starting Minikube in VirtualBox, try using Hyper-V
instead since Hyper-V is already required to run Docker on Windows.

This command sets up and starts a local {kube} cluster that is ready for deployment out of the box.
Later, when you no longer need your cluster, you can stop it with `minikube stop` and delete it completely
with `minikube delete`.

Next, in order to set-up an Ingress, you'll need to deploy the NGINX Ingress controller, which conveniently
comes as an optional add-on in Minikube. To enable this add-on, run the following command:

```
minikube addons enable ingress
```

When enabled, the Ingress controller deploys as a Pod in the `kube-system` namespace and configures
a front-end load balancer to use the rules defined in Ingress resources to route external traffic
to internal {kube} Services.

Next, install the Helm client and server by running the following command:

```
helm init
```

This command sets up `helm`, the Helm client, as well as `Tiller`, the Helm server. `Tiller` is
installed directly into your cluster and manages your chart releases (installations).

Next, add the IBM Helm chart repository to gain access to various IBM charts. This includes the
Open Liberty chart that you will use to deploy your two microservices:

```
helm repo add ibm-charts https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IBM/charts/master/repo/stable/
```

Finally, run the following command to configure the Docker CLI to use Minikube's Docker daemon.
By running this command, you will be able to interact with Minikube's Docker daemon and build new
images directly to it from your host machine:

```
# From Bash if you're on Linux or MacOS
eval $(minikube docker-env)
# From PowerShell or CMD if you're on Windows
minikube docker-env > tmp.cmd && call tmp.cmd && DEL tmp.cmd
```

When you no longer want to use Minikube's Docker daemon, run the following command to point back to your host:

```
# From Bash if you're on Linux or MacOS
eval $(minikube docker-env -u)
# From PowerShell or CMD if you're on Windows
minikube docker-env -u > tmp.cmd && call tmp.cmd && DEL tmp.cmd
```


// =================================================================================================
// Building and containerizing the microservices
// =================================================================================================

== Building and containerizing the microservices

The first step of deploying to {kube} is to build your microservices and containerize them with Docker.

The starting Java project, which you can find in the `start` directory, is a multi-module Maven
project that's made up of the `name` and `ping` microservices, each residing in their own directories,
`start/name` and `start/ping`. Each of these directories also contains a Dockerfile, which is necessary
for building Docker images. If you're unfamiliar with Dockerfiles, check out the https://openliberty.io/guides/docker.html[Docker guide],
which covers Dockerfiles in depth.

If you're familiar with Maven and Docker, you might be tempted to run a Maven build first and then
use the `.war` file produced by the build to build a Docker image. While this is by no means a wrong
approach, we've set-up the projects such that you can build your microservices and Docker image simultaneously
as a part of a single Maven build. This is done using the `dockerfile-maven` plugin, which automatically
picks up the Dockerfile located in the same directory as its POM file and builds a Docker image from it.
To build your microservices and Docker image, you shouldn't need to start Docker locally since you've
configured the Docker CLI to use Minikube's Docker daemon, so simply navigate to the `start` directory
and run the following command:

```
mvn package
```

The `package` goal automatically invokes the `dockerfile-maven:build` goal, which runs during the
`package` phase. This goal builds a Docker image from the Dockerfile located in the same directory
as the POM file.

During the build, you'll see various Docker messages describing what images are being downloaded and
built. If the build is successful, run the following command to list all local Docker images:

```
docker images
```

Verify that the `name:1.0-SNAPSHOT` and `ping:1.0-SNAPSHOT` images are listed among them:

If you don't see the `name:1.0-SNAPSHOT` and `ping:1.0-SNAPSHOT` images in Minikube's Docker image
list or if they were built to your local Docker cache rather than Minikube's, then check the Maven
build log for any potential errors and make sure that your Docker CLI is configured to use Minikube's
Docker daemon and not your host's as described in <<Starting and preparing your cluster for Deployment>>.


// =================================================================================================
// Installing a Helm chart release
// =================================================================================================

== Installing a Helm chart release

Now that your Docker images are built, deploy them using the Open Liberty Helm chart.

As mentioned previously, charts are sets of {kube} resources, such as Deployments,
Services, Ingresses, and so on, all configured conveniently for some purpose. In this case, that purpose
is to run microservices in Open Liberty. All resources that are installed through a chart are configurable
just like any other {kube} resources, allowing you to tweak them to your liking. All chart resources
are also deleted whenever the chart release is purged, allowing you to easily deploy a set of resources
to your cluster, configure them, and then tear them all down simultaneously when they are no longer needed.

To install a chart release, use the `helm install --name [RELEASE-NAME] [CHART] [FLAGS]` command.

First, install the Open Liberty chart for the `name` microservice:

```
helm install --name ol-name --set image.pullPolicy=IfNotPresent --set image.repository=name --set image.tag=1.0-SNAPSHOT --set ssl.enabled=false --set service.port=9080 --set service.targetPort=9080 --set ingress.enabled=true --set ingress.secureBackends=false --set ingress.rewriteTarget=/api/name --set ingress.path=/name ibm-charts/ibm-open-liberty
```

Then, for the the `ping` microservice:

```
helm install --name ol-ping --set image.pullPolicy=IfNotPresent --set image.repository=ping --set image.tag=1.0-SNAPSHOT --set ssl.enabled=false --set service.port=9080 --set service.targetPort=9080 --set ingress.enabled=true --set ingress.secureBackends=false --set ingress.rewriteTarget=/api/ping --set ingress.path=/ping ibm-charts/ibm-open-liberty
```

*Temporary instructions:*
Patch the ingresses by running the following two commands:
```
kubectl patch ingress/ol-name-ibm-open-liberty -p '{ "metadata": { "annotations": { "nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/affinity": "cookie", "nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target": "/api/name", "nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/session-cookie-hash": "sha1", "nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/session-cookie-name": "route" }}}'
```
```
kubectl patch ingress/ol-ping-ibm-open-liberty -p '{ "metadata": { "annotations": { "nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/affinity": "cookie", "nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target": "/api/ping", "nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/session-cookie-hash": "sha1", "nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/session-cookie-name": "route" }}}'
```

// On windows:
// kubectl patch ingress/ol-name-ibm-open-liberty -p "{ \"metadata\": { \"annotations\": { \"nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/affinity\": \"cookie\", \"nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target\": \"/api/name\", \"nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/session-cookie-hash\": \"sha1\", \"nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/session-cookie-name\": \"route\" }}}"

Both of these chart releases will create three {kube} resources each: a Deployment for managing Pods,
a Service for defining how Pods are accessed, and an Ingress for defining how external traffic is routed
to the Service.

Each command is long and has a lot of flags, so let's break them down:

[cols="15, 100", options="header"]
|===
| *Flag* | *Description*
| name   | Name for the chart release.
| set    | Overrides a configuration value in the chart.
|===

Next, let's break down the parameters:

[cols="15, 15, 100", options="header"]
|===
| *Qualifier* | *Argument*     | *Description*
| image       | pullPolicy     | Image pull policy. In this case, you're using `IfNotPresent` for both
                                 microservices to have {kube} pick up the local `name` and `ping`
                                 images rather than attempting to pull them from a public registry.
|             | repository     | Image name.
|             | tag            | Image tag. In this case, you're using `1.0-SNAPSHOT` for both microservices
                                 since it's the version of your Maven project.
| ssl         | enable         | Specifies whether to use SSL. In this case, you're disabling it since
                                 both microservices are not secured. As a result, you are also using
                                 the `9080` HTTP port for the `port` and `targetPort` parameters.
| service     | port           | The port exposed by the container.
|             | targetPort     | The port that will be exposed externally by the Pod.
| ingress     | enable         | Specifies whether to create an Ingress. An Ingress is a collection of rules
                                 that enable inbound requests to reach the internal {kube} Services.
|             | secureBackends | Tells NGINX which protocol to use to reach the backend services.
                                 HTTPS if set to `true` and HTTP otherwise. In this case, since your
                                 microservices are not secured, you're using plain HTTP.
|             | rewriteTarget  | The endpoint where the traffic will be redirected. In this case, you're
                                 using the endpoints where your microservices are served.
|             | path           | A path to which the Ingress will map a particular backend service.
|===

If you need to use additional parameters or if you would like more information on the existing parameters,
visit the official IBM chart https://github.ibm.com/IBMPrivateCloud/charts/tree/master/stable/ibm-open-liberty[GitHub repository].

When the charts are installed, run the following command to check the status of your Pods:

```
kubectl get pods
```

You'll see an output similar to the following if all the Pods are healthy and running:

[source, role="no_copy"]
----
NAME                                        READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
ol-name-ibm-open-liberty-84fcb9475d-mgzjk   1/1       Running   0          55m
ol-ping-ibm-open-liberty-6cb6ffd7b6-5pp7w   1/1       Running   0          4m
----

You can also inspect individual Pods in more detail by running the following command:

```
kubectl describe pods
```

You can also issue the `kubectl get` and `kubectl describe` commands on other {kube} resources, so feel
free to inspect all other resources created by the chart.

Wait for the Pods to be in the ready state, then access them from the Ingress that you created earlier.
If the `host` field is not specified in an Ingress, it will use your cluster's IP address. To obtain
the IP address of your Minikube cluster, run the `minikube ip` command, the IP address will be {minikube-ip}
by default. Then `curl` or visit the following URLs to access your microservices:

- https://{minikube-ip}/name/
- https://{minikube-ip}/ping/ol-name-ibm-open-liberty

The first URL will return a brief greeting followed by the name of the Pod that the `name` microservice
runs in. The second URL will return `pong` if it received a good response from the `ol-name-ibm-open-liberty`
{kube} Service. Visiting https://{minikube-ip}/ping/{kube-service} in general will return either
a good or a bad response depending on whether `kube-service` is a valid {kube} Service that can be accessed.

There is a lot going when you send a request, so let's break it down. When you issue a request to either
URL, the NGINX Ingress controller sees the request arrive at the apiserver's `/ingresses` endpoint and
re-routes this request appropriately using the set of rules defined in the appropriate Ingress resource.
This set of rules states that all requests made to the https://{minikube-ip}/name/ URL are to be mapped
to the `/api/name` endpoint of the {kube} Service running `name` Pods, and similarly for the https://{minikube-ip}/ping/
URL. When a request arrives at a {kube} Service, the Service uses its own set of rules to map this
request to a Pod, which then sends back a response, which the Service passes back to the client.


// =================================================================================================
// Scaling a deployment
// ================================================================================================

== Scaling a deployment

To make use of load balancing and session persistence that comes with your Ingress, you need
to scale your deployments. When you scale a Deployment, you replicate its Pods, creating more running
instances of your applications. Scaling is one of the primary advantages of {kube} because it allows to
accommodate more traffic, and descale them to free up resources when the traffic decreases.

As an example, scale the `name` Deployment to 3 Pods by running the following command:

```
kubectl scale deployment/ol-name-ibm-open-liberty --replicas=3
```

Wait for your two new Pods to be in the ready state, then `curl` or visit the https://{minikube-ip}/name/ URL.
Each **unique** session that you open to this URL will display a different Pod name, one for each of
your three running Pods. Also notice that no matter how many unique sessions you open to this URL, your
Ingress controller balances your traffic evenly among the three Pods.

Opening a **non-unique** session results in you connecting to the same Pod each time. This behavior
is called session persistence, meaning that requests from non-unique HTTP/HTTPs sessions are routed
to the same backend services each time in order to persist any data that might have been created during
the first session. Session persistence is provided by your Ingress controller and can be configured
and disabled from your Ingress resource.

The Open Liberty helm chart also supports automatic scaling that you can enable by setting the
`autoscaling.enabled` parameter to `true` when installing the chart. See the official Open Liberty Helm
chart https://github.ibm.com/IBMPrivateCloud/charts/tree/master/stable/ibm-open-liberty[GitHub repository]
for more information on this parameter.


// =================================================================================================
// Rolling out Deployment updates
// =================================================================================================

== Rolling out Deployment updates

Whenever you make code changes and rebuild your Docker images, you need to update your {kube}
Deployments with the new image versions for the new code changes to be picked up.

As an example, make a small change to the `name` microservice and then update the `ol-name-ibm-open-liberty`
Deployment that's already installed in your cluster.

First, navigate to the `start` directory if you haven't yet and change the greeting message in
`name/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/name/NameResource.java` file from "Hello!" to "Greetings!" :

[source, Java]
----
package io.openliberty.guides.name;

import javax.enterprise.context.RequestScoped;
import javax.ws.rs.GET;
import javax.ws.rs.Path;
import javax.ws.rs.Produces;
import javax.ws.rs.core.MediaType;

@RequestScoped
@Path("/")
public class NameResource {

    @GET
    @Produces(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN)
    public String getContainerName() {
        return "Greetings! I'm container " + System.getenv("HOSTNAME");
    }

}
----

Next, specify a new version for your Maven project. This way, when your microservice rebuilds, a
Docker image with a new tag will be built alongside it. To change the Maven project version, run
the following command:

```
mvn versions:set -DnewVersion=1.1-SNAPSHOT
```

This command will upgrade the parent project version from `1.0-SNAPSHOT` to `1.1-SNAPSHOT` and
propagate this change automatically to the child projects:

Next, navigate to the `name` directory within the `start` directory and run the `mvn clean package`
command to rebuild the `name` microservice, then verify that a new `name:1.1-SNAPSHOT` image was created:

[source, role="no_copy"]
----
$ docker images
REPOSITORY                                                       TAG
name                                                             1.1-SNAPSHOT
ping                                                             1.0-SNAPSHOT
name                                                             1.0-SNAPSHOT
----

To deploy this new image into your cluster, you can either install a new chart release, specifying
the new image version in the `image.tag` parameter, or you can upgrade the existing `ol-name-ibm-open-liberty`
Deployment that's part of your `ol-name` release.

Installing a new chart release is done using the same the same `helm install` command as before. To
update an existing release, you need to update the image tag in the Deployment in order for it to point
to your new image version. To do this, run the following command:

```
kubectl set image deployment/ol-name-ibm-open-liberty ibm-open-liberty=name:1.1-SNAPSHOT --record
```

When you change the image tag, {kube} automatically creates new Pods that run this new image. {kube}
also keeps some of the old Pods alive until enough of the new Pods are running:

[source, role="no_copy"]
----
$ kubectl get pods
NAME                                        READY     STATUS        RESTARTS   AGE

ol-ping-ibm-open-liberty-6cb6ffd7b6-fhchz   1/1       Running       1          19h
----

When all of the new Pods are in the ready state and all of the old Pods terminate, `curl` or visit
the https://{minikube-ip}/name/ URL and verify that the greeting has changed.

=== Automating with Maven

To make the rollout of updates easier, we've created an `update-deployment` profile in the `pom.xml`
files of each microservice. This profile uses the Maven exec plugin to automatically run the `kubectl set image`
command and update the Deployments.

To have Maven update the Deployments after it rebuilds your microservices, update the Maven project
version to a new version and then run a Maven build, specifying the profile name after the `-P` flag:

```
mvn clean package -P update-deployment
```

If new updates were made to a Deployment, you will see a brief message in the Maven build log, like so:

[source, role="no_copy"]
----
...
[INFO] --- exec-maven-plugin:1.6.0:exec (update-kubernetes-deployment) @ name ---
deployment.apps "ol-name-ibm-open-liberty" image updated
...
----

If no updates were made to a Deployment, then no special messages will show. If you did make code changes,
yet the deployment didn't update, then make sure that you updated your image tag since {kube} will not
update a deployment that's already using the same image version.


// =================================================================================================
// Rolling back Deployments to previous revisions
// =================================================================================================

== Rolling back Deployments to previous revisions

If you rolled out an unstable Deployment update, then you can revert the Deployment back to a older
revision by viewing its revision history. To do this, run the following command:

```
kubectl rollout history deployment/ol-name-ibm-open-liberty
```

You see the following revision history for the `ol-name-ibm-open-liberty` Deployment:

[source, role="no_copy"]
----
deployments "ol-name-ibm-open-liberty"
REVISION  CHANGE-CAUSE
1         <none>
2         kubectl set image deployment/ol-name-ibm-open-liberty ibm-open-liberty=name:1.1-SNAPSHOT --record=true
----

To undo the greeting messages changes that you made in the current rollout and revert the Deployment
back to its previous version, run the following command:

```
kubectl rollout undo deployment/ol-name-ibm-open-liberty
```

{kube} will terminate any existing Pods that run this image version of the Deployment and create new
ones from the previous revision.

If you need to revert back to a specific revision, use the `--to-revision` flag followed by the revision number:

```
kubectl rollout undo deployment/ol-name-ibm-open-liberty --to-revision=1
```

// Testing microservices that are running on {kube}
// =================================================================================================

== Testing microservices that are running on {kube}

A few tests are included for you to test the basic functionality of the microservices. If a test failure
occurs, then you might have introduced a bug into the code. To run the tests, wait for all Pods to be
in the ready state, then run the `mvn verify` command with the following list of properties:

[cols="15, 100", options="header"]
|===
| *Property*        | *Description*
| cluster.ip        | IP address of your Minikube cluster, `{minikube-ip}` by default.
| name.ingress.path | Ingress path of the `name` microservice, `/name` by default.
| ping.ingress.path | Ingress path of the `ping` microservice, `/ping` by default.
| name.kube.service | Name of the {kube} Service wrapping the `name` Pods, `ol-name-ibm-open-liberty` by default.
|===

For example:

```
mvn verify -Ddockerfile.skip=true
```

This command will run integration tests with all default properties. The `dockerfile.skip` parameter
is set to `true` in order to skip building a new Docker image.

If the tests pass, you'll see an output similar to the following for each service respectively:

== Tearing down the chart release

When you no longer need your deployed microservices, you can destroy all {kube} resource associated 
with your chart release by running the `helm del` command:

```
helm del --purge ol-name
helm del --purge ol-ping
```

By deleting your chart release, Helm deletes all {kube} resource created by that chart.


// =================================================================================================
// Editing {kube} resources
// =================================================================================================

== Optional: Editing {kube} resources

While you don't need to edit any of the {kube} resources in this guide, it might be helpful for
you to know how editing is done for any future projects that you have in mind.

To make changes to a {kube} resource, you can either edit that resource's whole YAML file in a text
editor or update particular parts of the YAML with the `kubectl` command.

=== Direct editing

Resource YAML files can be directly edited from the {kube} dashboard or a text editor of your choice.

To edit a resource from the Minikube dashboard, run the `minikune dashboard` command to open the Minikube
dashboard, then use the left navigational panel to select which resources to edit.

To open and edit a resource in a text editor, run the `kubectl edit (RESOURCE/NAME | -f FILENAME) [options]`
command, specifying the resource type and its name. When you save your changes, they will be automatically
picked up and applied to your resource.

If you didn't create resources through charts, but rather implemented and created them yourself from
YAML files by using the `kubectl create` command, then you can edit these YAMLs directly and then
reapply them by running the `kubectl apply -f [FILENAME] options` command.

To familiarize yourself with resource editing, edit the `ol-name-ibm-open-liberty` Ingress and change
the `path` field in the `spec` object from `/name` to `/myname`. Use any editing method you prefer:

        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
----

When you're done editing, visit the new Ingress endpoint to verify that your changes have been applied.


=== Indirect editing

Indirect editing of resources can be done by using various `kubectl` commands. If you recall,
you've already done this when you ran `kubectl set image` to update the image used by your Deployment
to a newer version. `kubectl set` is convenient, but it's limited to a small set of fields that you can
change. Sometimes you might need to change parts of a resource that the `kubectl set` command simply
doesn't cover. In those cases and as an alternative to the `kubectl set` command, you can use the
`kubectl patch (-f FILENAME | TYPE NAME) -p PATCH [options]` command to make updates using strategic
merging. The `kubectl patch` command works by supplying a piece of config in a form of a JSON or a YAML
that matches another piece of similar config in the resource and overrides the fields that don't match.
For example, to change the Ingress path from `/name` to `/myname` as in the previous section, run the
following command:

```
# From Bash if you're on Linux or MacOS
kubectl patch ingress/ol-name-ibm-open-liberty -p '{"spec": {"rules": [{"http": {"paths": [{"path": "/myname", "backend": {"serviceName": "ol-name-ibm-open-liberty", "servicePort": 9080}}]}}]}}'
# From PowerShell or CMD if you're on Windows
kubectl patch ingress/ol-name-ibm-open-liberty -p "{\"spec\": {\"rules\": [{\"http\": {\"paths\": [{\"path\": \"/myname\", \"backend\": {\"serviceName\": \"ol-name-ibm-open-liberty\", \"servicePort\": 9080}}]}}]}}"
```

{kube} will match your config pattern against the `spec` object defined in the `ol-name-ibm-open-liberty`
Ingress and override the `path` field.

== Great work! You're done!

You have just deployed two microservices to {kube} using Helm charts. You then scaled a microservice,
rolled out deployment updates, ran integration tests against miroservices that are running in a {kube}
cluster, and learned how to edit {kube} resources.
