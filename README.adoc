// =================================================================================================
// What is {kube}
// =================================================================================================

== What is {kube}?

{kube} is an open source container orchestrator that automates many tasks involved in deploying,
managing, and scaling containerized applications.

Over the years, {kube} has become a major tool in containerized environments as containers are being
further leveraged for all steps of a continuous delivery pipeline.

=== Why use {kube}?

Managing individual containers can be challenging. While a few containers used for development by
a small team might not pose a problem. Hundreds of containers, all running various applications,
all sharing databases, all communicating with each other, and all run and monitored
daily will give even a large team of experienced developers a headache. {kube} is
a primary tool for development in containerized
environments. It handles scheduling, deployment, as well as mass deletion and creation of containers.
It provides update rollout abilities on a large scale that would otherwise prove extremely tedious
to do. Imagine that you updated a Docker image, which now needs to propagate to a dozen containers.
While you could destroy and then re-create these containers, you can also run a short one-line
command to have {kube} make all those updates for you. Of course this is just a simple example.
{kube} has a lot more to offer.

// {kube} provides much other functionality
// that simply makes your development, testing, and production environments much more stable, much more
// automated, and much more powerful to use. Some of this functionality, we're hoping you can learn in
// this guide.

=== Architecture

Deploying an application to Kubernetes means deploying an application to a Kubernetes cluster.

A typical {kube} cluster is a collection of physical or virtual machines called nodes that run
containerized applications. A cluster is made up of one master node that manages the cluster, and
many worker nodes that run the actual application instances inside {kube} objects called pods.

A pod is a basic building block in a {kube} cluster. It represents a single running process that
encapsulates a container or in some scenarios many closely coupled containers. Pods can be
replicated to scale applications and handle more traffic. From the perspective of a cluster, a set
of replicated pods is still one application instance, although it might be made up of dozens of
instances of itself. A single pod or a group of replicated pods are managed by {kube} objects
called controllers. A controller handles replication, self-healing, rollout of updates, and general
management of pods. One example of a controller that you will use in this guide is a deployment.

A pod or a group of replicated pods are abstracted through {kube} objects called services
that define a set of rules by which the pods can be accessed. In a basic scenario, a {kube}
service exposes a node port that can be used together with the cluster IP address to access
the pods encapsulated by the service.

To learn about the various Kubernetes resources that you can configure, see the https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/[official {kube} documentation].


// =================================================================================================
// Introduction
// =================================================================================================

== What you'll learn

You will learn how to deploy two microservices in Open Liberty containers to a local {kube} cluster.
You will then manage your deployed microservices using the `kubectl` command line
interface for {kube}. The `kubectl` CLI is your primary tool for communicating with and managing your
{kube} cluster.

The two microservices you will deploy are called `name` and `ping`. The `name` microservice simply
displays a brief greeting and the name of the
container that it runs in, making it easy to distinguish it from its other replicas. The `ping` microservice
simply pings the {kube} Service that encapsulates the pods running the `name` microservice. This demonstrates
how communication can be established between pods inside a cluster.

You will use a local single-node {kube} cluster.

// =================================================================================================

== Building and containerizing the microservices

The first step of deploying to {kube} is to build your microservices and containerize them with Docker.

The starting Java project, which you can find in the `start` directory, is a multi-module Maven
project that's made up of the `name` and `ping` microservices. Each microservice resides in its own directory,
`start/name` and `start/ping`. Each of these directories also contains a Dockerfile, which is necessary
for building Docker images. If you're unfamiliar with Dockerfiles, check out the
https://openliberty.io/guides/docker.html[Using Docker containers to develop microservices] guide,
which covers Dockerfiles in depth.

If you're familiar with Maven and Docker, you might be tempted to run a Maven build first and then
use the `.war` file produced by the build to build a Docker image. While it is by no means a wrong
approach, we've setup the projects such that this process is automated
as a part of a single Maven build. This is done by using the `dockerfile-maven` plug-in, which automatically
picks up the Dockerfile located in the same directory as its POM file and builds a Docker image from it.
If you're using Docker for Windows ensure that, on the Docker for Windows _General Setting_ page, the option is set to `Expose daemon on tcp://localhost:2375 without TLS`. This is required by the `dockerfile-maven` part of the build.

Navigate to the `start` directory and run the following command:

```
mvn package
```

The `package` goal automatically invokes the `dockerfile-maven:build` goal, which runs during the
`package` phase. This goal builds a Docker image from the Dockerfile located in the same directory
as the POM file.

During the build, you'll see various Docker messages describing what images are being downloaded and
built. When the build finishes, run the following command to list all local Docker images:

```
docker images
```

Verify that the `name:1.0-SNAPSHOT` and `ping:1.0-SNAPSHOT` images are listed among them, for example:

If you don't see the `name:1.0-SNAPSHOT` and `ping:1.0-SNAPSHOT` images, then check the Maven
build log for any potential errors.
In addition, if you are using Minikube, make sure your Docker CLI is configured to use Minikube's Docker daemon and not your host's as described in the previous section.


// =================================================================================================
// Deploying the microservices
// =================================================================================================

== Deploying the microservices

Now that your Docker images are built, deploy them using a Kubernetes resource definition.

A Kubernetes resource definition is a yaml file that contains a description of all your deployments, services, or any other resources that you want to deploy. All resources can also be deleted from the cluster by using the same yaml file that you used to deploy them.

To deploy the `name` and `ping` applications, first create the `kubernetes.yaml` file in the `start` directory:

[source, yaml]
----
include::finish/kubernetes.yaml[tags=**;]
----

This file defines four {kube} resources. It defines two deployments and two services. A {kube} deployment is a resource responsible for controlling the creation and management of pods. A service exposes your deployment so that you can make requests to your containers. Three key items to look at when creating the deployments are the `label`, `image`, and `containerPort` fields. The `label` is a way for a {kube} service to reference specific deployments. The `image` is the name and tag of the docker image that you want to use for this container. Finally, the `containerPort` is the port that your container exposes for purposes of accessing your application. For the services, the key point to understand is that they expose your deployments. The binding between deployments and services is specified by the use of labels -- in this case the `app` label. You will also notice the service has a type of `NodePort`. This means you can access these services from outside of your cluster via a specific port. In this case, the ports will be `31000` and `32000`, but it can also be randomized if the `nodePort` field is not used.

Run the following commands to deploy the resources as defined in kubernetes.yaml:

```
kubectl apply -f kubernetes.yaml
```

When the apps are deployed, run the following command to check the status of your pods:

```
kubectl get pods
```

You'll see an output similar to the following if all the pods are healthy and running:

[source, role="no_copy"]
----
NAME                               READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
name-deployment-6bd97d9bf6-4ccds   1/1       Running   0          15s
ping-deployment-645767664f-nbtd9   1/1       Running   0          15s
----

You can also inspect individual pods in more detail by running the following command:

```
kubectl describe pods
```

You can also issue the `kubectl get` and `kubectl describe` commands on other {kube} resources, so feel
free to inspect all other resources.

Next you will make requests to your services.

****
[system]#*{win} | {mac}*#

The default hostname for Docker Desktop is `localhost`.

[system]#*{linux}*#

The default hostname for minikube is {minikube-ip}. Otherwise it can be found using the `minikube ip` command.
****

Then `curl` or visit the following URLs to access your microservices, substituting the appropriate hostname:

- {name-api}
- {ping-api}/name-service

The first URL returns a brief greeting followed by the name of the pod that the `name` microservice
runs in. The second URL returns `pong` if it received a good response from the `name-service`
{kube} Service. Visiting `{ping-api}/[kube-service]` in general returns either
a good or a bad response depending on whether `kube-service` is a valid {kube} Service that can be accessed.

// =================================================================================================
// Scaling a deployment
// ================================================================================================

== Scaling a deployment

To use load balancing, you need to scale your deployments. When you scale a deployment, you replicate its pods, creating more running instances of your applications. Scaling is one of the primary advantages of {kube} because replicating your application allows it to accommodate more traffic, and then descale your deployments to free up resources when the traffic decreases.

As an example, scale the `name` Deployment to 3 pods by running the following command:

```
kubectl scale deployment/name-deployment --replicas=3
```

Wait for your two new pods to be in the ready state, then `curl` or visit the `{name-api}` URL. You'll notice that the service will respond with a different name when you call it multiple times. This is because there are now three pods running all serving the `name` application.

== Redeploy microservices

When you are building your application, you may find that you want to quickly test a change. To do that, you can rebuild your docker images then delete and re-create your {kube} resources.

```
mvn package
kubectl delete -f kubernetes.yaml
kubectl apply -f kubernetes.yaml
```

This is not how you would want to update your applications when running in production, but in a development environment this is fine. If you want to deploy an updated image to a production cluster, you can update the container in your deployment with a new image. Then, {kube} will automate the creation of a new container and decommissioning of the old one once the new container is ready.

// =================================================================================================
// Testing microservices that are running on {kube}
// =================================================================================================

== Testing microservices that are running on {kube}

A few tests are included for you to test the basic functionality of the microservices. If a test failure
occurs, then you might have introduced a bug into the code. To run the tests, wait for all pods to be
in the ready state before proceeding further. The default properties defined in the `pom.xml` are:

[cols="15, 100", options="header"]
|===
| *Property*        | *Description*
| cluster.ip        | IP or hostname for your cluster, `{minikube-ip}` by default, which is appropriate when using Minikube.
| name.kube.service | Name of the {kube} Service wrapping the `name` pods, `name-service` by default.
| name.node.port    | The NodePort of the {kube} Service `name-service`, 31000 by default.
| ping.node.port    | The NodePort of the {kube} Service `ping-service`, 32000 by default.
|===

Navigate back to the `start` directory.

****
[system]#*{win} | {mac}*#

Run the integration tests against a cluster running with a hostname of `localhost`:

```
mvn verify -Ddockerfile.skip=true -Dcluster.ip=localhost
```

[system]#*{linux}*#

Run the integration tests against a cluster running at the default Minikube IP address:

```
mvn verify -Ddockerfile.skip=true
```

You can also run the integration tests with an IP address of `192.168.99.101`:

```
mvn verify -Ddockerfile.skip=true -Dcluster.ip=192.168.99.101
```
****

The `dockerfile.skip` parameter is set to `true` in order to skip building a new Docker image.

If the tests pass, you'll see an output similar to the following for each service respectively:

// =================================================================================================
// Tear Down
// =================================================================================================

== Tearing down the environment

When you no longer need your deployed microservices, you can delete all {kube} resources by running the `kubectl delete` command:

```
kubectl delete -f kubernetes.yaml
```

****
[system]#*{win} | {mac}*#

Nothing more needs to be done for Docker Desktop.

[system]#*{linux}*#

Perform the following two steps to return your environment to a clean state.

Firstly, point the Docker daemon back to your local machine:

```
eval $(minikube docker-env -u)
```

Then, stop your Minikube cluster:

```
minikube stop
```

Finally, delete your cluster:

```
minikube delete
```

****


// =================================================================================================
// finish
// =================================================================================================

== Great work! You're done!

You have just deployed two microservices to {kube}. You then scaled a microservice and ran integration tests against miroservices that are running in a {kube}
cluster.
